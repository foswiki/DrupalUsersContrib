---+!! DrupalUsersContrib Contrib Package

*tested with Drupal v6.5*


This Contrib enables you to replace the Foswiki User and Groups system with a read only access to the 
User and Groups in a [[http://drupal.com/][Drupal]] Database. Registration of new users and their 
association with Groups is then _only_ handled by Drupal, making it possible to remove the distributed Main web.

Usernames with spaces work fine, and Drupal Roles are mapped into Foswiki Groups.

You are advised to use the same same host for Foswiki and the Drupal Database, 
otherwise user query performance (happens every request) can severely degrade the response time.

By selecting DrupalLogin, Foswiki will also attempt to use the Drupal 'remember me' cookie
 though this requires the Foswiki and Drupal host names to be the same, and can cause some users issues especially if updates are made to Drupal.

---++ Settings

To use DrupalUsersMapping, you need to set the following settings in the "Security setup" in =configure=
   * UserMappingManager = 'Foswiki::Users::DrupalUserMapping'
   * (optional) LoginManager = 'Foswiki::LoginManager::DrupalLogin'
   (This setting will allow Foswiki to use the session cookie that Drupal provides.)

And then set the Drupal specific settings in the 
=User Managers= - =Drupal User Manager= Section

The DSN to connect to the Drupal Database.
   * $Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{DrupalUser}{DBI_dsn} = 'dbi:mysql:drupal:localhost';

The user to connect to the phpBB3 Database.
   * $Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{DrupalUser}{DBI_username} = 'mysql_user';

The password to connect to the phpBB3 Database.
   * $Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{DrupalUser}{DBI_password} = 'mysql_password';

The hostname that both your Drupal site and your Foswiki Site are at.
this is used to identify the Drupal session cookie, and so assumes there is 
only _one_ hostname used to access your site. (leave blank to use hostname from URL request.
   * $Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{DrupalUser}{DrupalHostname} = '';

Over-ride Foswiki authentication using _only_ the Drupal sessions
If there is no Drupal Session cookie, Foswiki will use the Guest user.
NOTE: you will need to specify a Drupal Login UI URL for Foswiki to redirect to to authenticate
   * $Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{DrupalUser}{DrupalAuthOnly} = $FALSE;
Drupal Login UI URL for Foswiki to redirect to to authenticate - used if =DrupalAuthOnly= is set to true
   * $Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{DrupalUser}{DrupalAuthURL} = 'http://drupal/blog?return=%BASEWEB%.%BASETOPIC%';
